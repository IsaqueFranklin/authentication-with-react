First of all:

- You'll need to create a firebase project and add your credentials to the env.local file.
- Then you'll need to install react-bootstrap and firebase directly in your terminal.

Now if I'm not wrong or if I didn't forget something you should be ready to go.

If there is any other problem or missing package, just install it in your terminal.
